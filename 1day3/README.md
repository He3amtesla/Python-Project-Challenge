## Day 1: Optimizing VSCode for Coding

### Yesterday's Project:
Optimizing VSCode for a better coding experience by installing useful extensions.

#### Key Features Added:
- **Material Theme & Icons**: For a clean and modern look.
- **Better Comments**: To organize and highlight comments effectively.
- **GitLens**: For Git integration and tracking changes.
- **Snippet Creator**: To create and reuse custom code snippets.
- **Project Manager & ToDo Tree**: For managing projects and tracking tasks.
- **Codesnap**: For creating beautiful screenshots of code.
- **Peacock**: To color-code VSCode windows for multiple projects.

#### Challenges Faced:
- Finding extensions that work well together without overloading the editor.
- Understanding the customization options for some extensions, like Better Comments.

#### What I Learned:
1. How to customize themes and icons to improve the look of VSCode.
2. Integrating useful extensions to boost productivity.
3. Balancing functionality and simplicity in a workspace.

#### Next Steps:
Today, I plan to work on a project about **how to download source code**.
