# Day 16 of the 66-Day Python Challenge ðŸ“…

## Today's Topic: Review of Past Content and New Materials from the Last 7 Days

### ðŸŽ¯ What Did I Do?

Yesterday, I planned to study the LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle), but I forgot that every 7 days I should review the previous material. As a result, today I focused on reviewing the past content and will tackle the LSP principle tomorrow.

Today marks the eighth day since the last review, so I decided to do a comprehensive review of what I've learned over the past 7 days. This includes projects like the "Number Guesser Project - Solution B", familiarizing myself with project directories in Python, how to write README.md and requirements.txt files, and studying software design principles (SOLID). Additionally, I worked on exercises related to managing project packages and introducing directories to the Python path.

### ðŸš€ Tomorrow's Plan (2025/1/2):

Tomorrow, I will study and review the LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle).
