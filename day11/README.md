## üéØ Description:  
Today, I focused on learning how to write a README file for GitHub projects. I became acquainted with the Markdown format and learned how to create a standard and professional description file. I also explored online tools for creating tables in Markdown.  
By searching for the phrase `"Markdown Table Generator Online"`, you can easily find useful tools for building tables.
