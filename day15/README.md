# Day 15 of the 66-Day Python Challenge ðŸ“…

## Today's Learning Topic: OCP (Open/Closed Principle) in Programming

ðŸŽ¯ **What did I do today?**

Today, I learned about the OCP (Open/Closed Principle). This principle states that code should be open for adding new features and closed for modification. In other words, we should be able to add new features without changing the existing code. To achieve this, we can use abstract classes and create new classes from them to introduce new features.

ðŸ”‘ **What did I learn?**

- **OCP Principle**: This principle is one of the SOLID principles and suggests that code should allow for the addition of new features without requiring modifications to existing code.

âœ… **Benefits**:
- Openness of code for adding features
- Flexibility in code
- Improved readability of code

ðŸš€ **Tomorrow's Plan** (_Program for the New Year Ahead_):

Tomorrow, I plan to study the LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) and learn how it can help improve code structure.
