**Today's Learning Topic:** Intro (Python Bootcamp - Project Ideas)

**Description:** Today I focused on "Python Bootcamp - Project Ideas"
1:06:52--------/---------- video
(Resume <-- 48:00)

I learned many things from this seemingly Intro section.
I also did a quick review of the lessons from the past seven days.

**Key Learning Points Today:**
"
- **#INTENTCLASSIFICATION** 🌐
- **#NLP** 🧠
- **#Diagram** 📊
- **#Acronym** 🅰️
- **#Component** 🔧
- **#RAGAI** 🤖
- **#ProjectManagement** 📈
- **#TradeOff** ⚖️
- **#Milestone** 🎯

**What I Learned:**

INTENT CLASSIFICATION is a process for finding what a language NLP wants; for example, there is a user, when the user says something like "what's the weather like in Tabriz city", this INTENT Classification checks the weather box and Tabriz city based on this, and finally gives somewhat relevant output.

**Diagram** is a visual representation for showing connections like nodes

**Acronym**, refers to words that are abbreviated meanings that when joined together, the abbreviations of the word form a new meaningful word. (Of course, these connected initial letters are later converted to meaning by others)

**Component** is a separate part of the main program structure that works independently.

Intents are like letters that contain a series of instructions inside, their operation is like when someone goes to the university education department and based on what that person said, they give a letter saying go give this letter to the management section to get your work done.

RAG AI:
Question --> 10 documents that could answer the question, they give these 10 documents to llm to give the answer, it uses search engine.

Project Management:
-Some programs we write, we just write quickly to release them to get people's reaction to using the program, then fix them in later versions
-But there are some that we need to write the program in a way that doesn't ruin the reputation (customer's view of the company, or ...) of previous customers that we worked hard for, and it must be a solid program from every aspect

Trade Off means for example we have two choices but must choose one, we choose one that has more advantages and give up the advantages of the other choice

milestone: means turning point or important stage of project, milestones are like medium-term goals of a long-term goal in project; they are defined before the project to help the project better reach its final goal.

First we define milestones for the project then we break down the milestone into several tasks.

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
Tomorrow I plan to work on Python Project + Book (Part **#1**).
