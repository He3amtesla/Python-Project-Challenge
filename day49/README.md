# Day 49 of the 66-Day Challenge - Python Project ðŸ“…

## **Learning Title for Today**: Python Project + Book (Part 1)(1-2)

### **Explanation**:

Today I decided to add some variety to my study program. Why? Because I hadnâ€™t watched any long educational videos for a few months, and thatâ€™s why I hadnâ€™t encountered this challenge, a challenge that would take more of my time and gradually discourage me. Although today I felt a bit unmotivated, as my brain was inclined to rest (laziness). So, I decided to change my plan and break the long videos into parts. After watching, I would note down the key points and the exact second, then return to that second and practice.

Tomorrow, I will review this part of the video with more practice and finish it.
