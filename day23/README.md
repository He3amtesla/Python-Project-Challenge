# Day 23 of the 66-Day Python Project Challenge ðŸ“…

## Explanation:
Today, I fell behind because I started my tasks at 12 o'clock! Additionally, I wrote an article about prompts, which took up my time, and I tried my best not to lose in this challenge I initiated.
Well, moving on, today I learned that when we receive a project from the employer, if we encounter any issues in the project, we should ask for guidance to see if the project is progressing according to the employer's wishes.
Also, there's a point in project development that we should first draw a plan and then implement it, especially in large projects. It's a mistake to start coding without a plan. (In Jupyter, comments should be made after completing the mapping (plan) before writing the code.)
Furthermore, every time we add something to the code, we should test it to be aware of potential errors. This way, if we encounter a small error, we can fix it quickly rather than writing everything and then running it to see how many errors we have. Each error may require us to correct other parts of our code as well (the errors are different).
Appropriate spacing for better code readability:
In classes, leave one line of space between methods.
Outside functions, leave two lines of space.
I practiced coding a bit today, but it was not enough; I just copied someone else's code without fully thinking it through. Because of this, tomorrow I plan to practice a bit more and review all my recent studies.
Today, I couldn't fully practice the project, but I made an effort to learn something new.
And today, I did a very quick review of the topics from the past seven days.
