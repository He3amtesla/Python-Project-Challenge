# Day 23 of the 66-Day Python Project Challenge ðŸ“…

## Explanation:
Today, I fell behind because I started my tasks at 12 PM! Additionally, I wrote an article about prompts, which took up some of my time. Despite this, I did my best not to lose in this challenge I started.

Anyway, hereâ€™s what I learned today:

1. When receiving a project from a client, if there's an issue in the project, we should communicate and ask for guidance to ensure the project is progressing as they want.

2. Thereâ€™s an important tip for working on projects: **Always create a roadmap first, especially for large projects, before jumping into coding.** Itâ€™s a mistake to start coding without a clear plan. 
   - For example, in Jupyter Notebook, add comments first (as a roadmap) and then proceed to write the code.

3. Every time you add something to your code, test it immediately to be aware of potential errors. This practice helps fix minor errors quickly rather than writing the entire code and running it at the end, which might result in multiple errors. Fixing one error could lead to new ones, so it's better to tackle them incrementally.

4. Proper spacing for better code readability:
   - Inside a class, add one line of space between methods.
   - Outside the class, leave two lines of space between functions.

5. I did a bit of coding practice today, but it wasnâ€™t enough. I mostly followed someone elseâ€™s code without fully thinking it through myself. Thatâ€™s why tomorrow, I plan to dedicate more time to coding and review all the recent topics Iâ€™ve covered.

Although I couldnâ€™t fully practice my project today, I did my best to learn something new.
