### What did I do?
The list chooses randomly.

Today, I learned new things about practice projects. Now I know what information someone should provide when assigning us a project. Information like project descriptions, minimum required Python version and packages, hints, how to run the project, and what knowledge can be gained from completing it.

Tomorrow, I will work on a simple project: the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. Although this project seems easy, it’s an opportunity to revisit OOP concepts, work with the `random` library, and practice writing a `README.md` file. Additionally, I will use this project to practice the SOLID principles.

Regarding the `random` library, it has a function called `choice` that takes a list of strings, numbers, or instances of classes and randomly selects one item from the list.
```Python
import random

list_number = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(random.choice(list_number))
# A random number from 1, 2, 3, or 4 (selected randomly)
```
