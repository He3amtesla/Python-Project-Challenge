# Day 31 of the 66-Day Python Project Challenge ðŸ“…

## Today's Learning Title: Review Month Lesson (Phase 2-2) ðŸ“‘

### What I Did
Today, I started and completed Phase 2 of the 30-day review of past lessons. 
- Edited some vocabulary and sentences from previous lessons.
- Completed some incomplete sentences.
- Researched and added some concepts I found interesting to my documentation.

### Topics Reviewed Today:
1. Quiz and Review of SOLID Principles
2. Intro to Level I Projects
3. Intro to the Rock Paper Scissors Project
4. Rock Paper Scissors Implementation
5. Rock Paper Scissors Implementation (2)
6. Rock Paper Scissors Implementation (3)
7. Documenting Python Code
8. Rock Paper Scissors Documentation
9. Functions vs Classes (1-2)
10. Functions vs Classes (2-2) & Intro to Password Generator Project

### Important Points Added:

#### 1. `a!r <--> repr(a)`
- This function provides developers with more information about a variable.
- **Note:** `a!r` is only applicable within f-strings.

#### 2. Comments vs Code
- In code, we explain **how** things work.
- In comments, we discuss **why** we are doing something.

**_Note:_** Writing documentation is typically done outside the code. For instance, in script files, documentation is often placed in the `docs` directory.  
*(new edit date: 2025/1/16)*

#### 3. Usage of `__doc__`
- Another use of the `__doc__` dunder method is that it allows us to modify or add documentation to classes, methods, or functions from the outside.  
*(2025/1/16 --> or add to them)*

#### 4. Attributes vs Methods
- Inside a class:
  - **Attributes**: Represent data and are placed within the `__init__` method.  
    *(2025/1/16 --> Attributes are defined here.)*
  - **Methods**: Represent actions/behaviors and are defined separately.  
    *(2025/1/16 --> Behaviors are implemented as methods.)*

### Plan for Tomorrow:
Tomorrow, I will work on the Password Generator Project.
