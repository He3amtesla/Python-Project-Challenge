# Day 5 of 66 Days of Python Project Challenge  

---

## 🎯 My Experience  
This was my first Python project, and it was really enjoyable! It felt similar to the exercises my instructor used to give, but this time, I turned it into something usable and shareable. While the current code works fine, I plan to optimize it further in the next stages.

## 🛠️ Project Description  
The **Number Guesser Game** challenges the player to guess a random number between **0 and 100**.  
- The player starts with a score of **10**.  
- For each incorrect guess:  
  - **1 point** is deducted.  
  - A **hint** about the range of the number is provided.  
- If the score reaches **0**, the game ends, and the player loses.

## 🔍 Commands and Usage  
```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 0 and 100
random.randint(0, 100)  

# Generate a random between 0 and 1
round(random.random())
```

## 💡 What I Learned  
- How to use the `random` library in Python to generate random numbers.  
- Creating a simple game loop with input validation and error handling.  
- Enhancing the user experience by providing dynamic hints.

## 📝 Reflections  
This project showed me how small exercises can evolve into creative projects. The gameplay was fun, and I’m eager to optimize it further.
