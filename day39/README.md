**Title of Today's Learning:** Review and Streamlit Core Concepts

**Description:**
From today, I decided instead of reviewing 7 lessons in one day, I will review one lesson from the past 7 days each day, and learn one new topic every day.

Today was a very busy day, I opened a channel on Telegram because of this, so my attention was more focused there and my thoughts were on it, instead of being focused on the lesson, I was thinking about that place, I must find a solution in this matter.

Today I had a review of last week's lesson and looked at the Streamlit Core Concepts lesson day by day.

**What I Learned:**
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. (Review of last week's lesson)
- In Streamlit, we can place columns in the graphic space, and we can program something for each column (in other words, we can divide the site into three parts and code something for each column.)

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
Tomorrow, I will review the topics I learned in the past 7 days and work on the lesson I couldn't complete today.
