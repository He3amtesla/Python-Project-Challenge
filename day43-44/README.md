# Day 43 - 44 of 66-day Python Project Challenge ðŸ“…

## **Today's Learning Topic: My Project**

### Description:
Yesterday and today are the best days of my life. I'm very happy that I could finish the project I was writing, although there are some minor tasks remaining... Well, anyway.

Tomorrow I will make my project public.

But before that, today I need to do some tasks like editing the recorded program workflow and...

Yesterday I couldn't write my documentation because I was working on the project. I promised myself that if I make progress, it's okay if I don't write my documentation. This is kind of an excuse, but I like this excuse because it leads to my progress.
(Yesterday (day 43) I had a quick review of the past 7 days' lessons)

Actually, I was only thinking about developing my program, I wasn't thinking much about learning it, I just wanted to finish my project with whatever means possible to publish it today. I wrote some things to practice more:
- Transferring dataframe to another dataframe with selected columns
- Changing columns in dataframe
