# Day 50 of the 66-Day Python Project Challenge ðŸ“…  
## **Today's Learning Title:** Python Project + Book (Part 1)(1.2-2)  
### **Explanation:**
 Today, I reviewed the lessons from the last seven days, although I unfortunately forgot to review yesterday (I really donâ€™t want that to happen again) [[Day 5]].  
Today, I studied data organization, algorithms, and data structures. Even though I had studied this in university before, I didnâ€™t know much about data organization.

### What I Have Learned:  
In the age of technology, there are always challenges. In order to overcome these challenges and create something of our own, we need to understand the concepts of algorithms and data organization. In this post, I will cover these topics:

---

#### **Data Organization (Ø³Ø§Ø²Ù…Ø§Ù†Ø¯Ù‡ÛŒ Ø¯Ø§Ø¯Ù‡):**  
Imagine you have a library and you want to arrange the books in it. This is called data organization, or in other words, the way data is arranged in hardware for publication is called data organization.

---

#### **Algorithm (Ø§Ù„Ú¯ÙˆØ±ÛŒØªÙ…):**  
In the same library example, the way books are arranged, managed, and ordered in the library is called an algorithm. In other words, managing, ordering, and searching for data is what I call an algorithm.

---

#### **Data Structure (Ø³Ø§Ø®ØªÙ…Ø§Ù† Ø¯Ø§Ø¯Ù‡):**  
If you combine algorithms with data organization, you get a data structure. This means we manage how data is stored, found, or deleted in the data.

### What is the Benefit of Learning This Information?  
By learning this, we can achieve many things. Let me give you a modern example. The AI model "DeepSec," created by a Chinese company, was built with minimal resources. Since they didnâ€™t have the hardware or system to create a model as large as ChatGPT, they compressed the DeepSec AI algorithm so muchâ€”reducing both time complexity and space complexity of the codeâ€”so they could build a model similar to OpenAIâ€™s O1, which is that powerful.

By learning data structures, we can reduce the time and space complexity of the code, which will increase the speed of our program and require less space.

---

**Time Complexity:** Simply put, itâ€™s about increasing the speed of the code.

### **Tomorrow's Program:**  
I will continue this topic.
