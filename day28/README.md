# Day 28 of the 66-Day Python Project Challenge ðŸ“…

### Today's Learning Topic: Functions vs Classes (1/2)

#### What did I do?

This morning, I reviewed a newspaper-style educational video, then completed the "One Step Towards a Dream" challenge. After that, I revisited the "Functions vs Classes" topic but unfortunately learned it incompletely.

#### What did I learn? ðŸ”‘

We have several programming paradigms (styles). Functions and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) belong to the Declarative paradigm, which means abstracting parts of the code; the only goal is to achieve the important outcome, not how we achieve it. In contrast, the Imperative paradigm requires writing code line by line without abstracting the code.

_**Note:** The abstraction of functions is less than that of classes._

_**Note:** In OOP (Object-oriented programming), they have slightly less complexity compared to functions. (They remain in the code, but overall complexity is less)._

_**Note:** If in OOP, we excessively abuse one of the benefits of OOP such as Modularity, Reusability, Maintainability, Versatility, it leads to the complexity of our classes._

Don't waste your time unnecessarily; use your knowledge when needed. _"Ali Hejazi"_

We need to look at the team and the code to see whether writing in objects is better or using functions or both.

If the team doesn't know OOP, the project should proceed using another method.

Below, we have all these design patterns, code writing templates.

### English words frequently used in this lesson:

- state
- mute data
- condition
- stateless
- predictability
- verbosity
- abuse
- versatility
- overhead
- flow

#### Tomorrow's Plan (2025/1/14) ðŸ”®

Tomorrow, I intend to practice today's lesson again.
I will practice a little more tomorrow to make up for the lack of reading today
