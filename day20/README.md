## Today's Learning Topic: Review and Quiz on SOLID Principles ðŸ’¡

### What did I do?

Today, I had a quick review of the SOLID principles and participated in a quiz related to the SOLID Principles.

### What did I learn? ðŸ”‘

- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):** Every class we define should have responsibility for one thing or one change. If a class has multiple responsibilities, making changes to it becomes more difficult because we have to change all responsibilities of the class simultaneously.

- **Interfaces:** Interfaces are a set of contracts based on object-oriented principles that we follow by adhering to them. Interfaces act like the framework of a building, and a subclass that inherits from an abstract class must implement all the methods defined in the interface.

*(Of course, they are mostly more like rules, because if we don't follow them, we encounter errors in some of them.)*
