### Today's Learning Topic: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

ðŸŽ¯ **What did I do?**
Today, I learned about the ISP (Interface Segregation Principle). I learned that ISP means that no class or module should be forced to depend on interfaces it doesn't use. For example, it's like a store that only sells products related to its business and does not sell items unrelated to its work. In code, this principle is implemented by designing interfaces in such a way that classes only implement what they need.

ðŸ”‘ **What did I learn?**
ISP is one of the SOLID principles, emphasizing that interfaces should be small and specific enough for classes to only inherit what they need from these parent interfaces. This principle prevents creating large and general interfaces that force classes to implement unnecessary methods.

âœ… **Benefits:**
- Reduces code complexity
- Increases maintainability and scalability
- Prevents unnecessary dependencies
- Improves code readability and understanding

ðŸš€ **Tomorrow's Plan (2025/1/4):**
Tomorrow, I plan to study the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
