# Day 21 of the 66-Day Python Project Challenge 📅

## Today's Learning Title: Intro to Level 💡

### Description:
I’m not feeling very well today. Maybe it’s because I stayed up late last night watching anime!  
Nonetheless, I spent some time reviewing the projects I want to challenge myself with.  
Tomorrow, I’ll be starting my new project 😁
